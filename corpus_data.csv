Just a reminder that this subreddit is for the City of Corona, CA and related topics	MartOut	2020/01/28	https://www.reddit.com/r/corona/comments/ev10jd/just_a_reminder_that_this_subreddit_is_for_the/	Hey all, Yes, the name of our city bears resemblance to that of a deadly virus outbreak going on right now. While our city typically has nothing else to discuss, I must ask you to at least keep the posts relevant. I am personally OK with users posting and discussing when major news breaks (I like to think of it as gossip). I am not OK with shallow jokes or irrelevant discussion. If your post was/is removed, it was likely deemed off-topic or too similar to posts that already exist. For those looking for the appropriate virus-related subreddit try /r/coronavirus or /r/COVID19 . ***City residents - check out the City website link [here](https://www.coronaca.gov/i-want-to/learn-more-about/coronavirus) or in the sidebar for updates.*** -MartOutEDIT: I have updated many things in an effort to reduce the bot spam. If you believe one of your posts was removed in error, please notify the mods and we will work with you to have your post approved.
Is it possible that taking the Covid vaccine made me worse than before?	Intelligent-Bag-9419	2024/01/07	https://www.reddit.com/r/corona/comments/190lpmn/is_it_possible_that_taking_the_covid_vaccine_made/	For context, I have taken four pfizer shots, with the last one being just last year. I also got my flu shoot 2 weeks prior and have always taken the flu every year.I haven’t been sick for about 4 years, and the one time I was sick was caused by a prior Covid vaccine. Well one week after I take my Covid shot, I’m now really sick, really sore throat that also feels congested, intense chest pains whenever I cough, and when I’m coughing a lot more, with my coughs sounding very hoarse as well. Wondering if anyone else had a similar experience or thoughts about it.
Skyline Trail Bikes	A9-EE-78-6A-C8-9F	2023/12/27	https://www.reddit.com/r/corona/comments/18rmysh/skyline_trail_bikes/	Does anyone know if ebikes are allowed up skyline? I want to get to the top of the mountain for some photos real fast but I don't wanna make it a call day event hiking up. Any advice would be appreciated
Corona product of signed graphs and its application to signed network  modelling	Bibhas Adhikari, Amrik Singh, Sandeep Kumar Yadav	2019/08/27	http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10018v1	The notion of corona of two graphs was introduced by Frucht and Harary in1970. In this paper we generalize their definition of corona product of twographs and introduce corona product of two signed graphs by utilizing theframework of marked graphs, which was introduced by Beineke and Harary in 1978.We study the structural and spectral properties of corona product of signedgraphs. Further we define signed corona graphs by considering corona product ofa fixed small signed graph with itself iteratively, and we call the small graphas the seed graph for the corresponding corona graphs. Signed corona graphs canbe employed as a signed network generative model for large growing signednetworks. We study structural properties of corona graphs that includestatistics of signed links, all types of signed triads and degree distribution.Besides we analyze algebraic conflict of signed corona graphs generated byspecially structured seed graphs. Finally we show that a suitable choice of aseed graph can produce corona graphs which preserve properties of real signednetworks.
On convergence in the subpower Higson corona of metric spaces	Jacek Kucab, Mykhailo Zarichnyi	2017/01/03	http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00721v2	The subpower Higson corona of a proper metric space is defined in \cite{KZ}.We prove that, unlikely to the Higson corona, the closure of a $\sigma$-compactsubset of the subpower Higson corona of a proper unbounded metric space doesnot necessarily coincide with its Stone-\v{C}ech corona.
Unveiling the Nature of Coronae in Active Galactic Nuclei through Sub-mm  Observations	Yoshiyuki Inoue, Akihiro Doi	2014/11/10	http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2334v1	The heating mechanism of a corona above an accretion disk in active galacticnuclei (AGNs) is still unknown. One possible mechanism is magnetic reconnectionheating requiring energy equipartition between magnetic energy and gas energyin the disk. Here, we investigate the expected observed properties in radioband from such a magnetized corona. A magnetized corona can generatesynchrotron radiation since a huge amount of electrons exists. Although most ofradiation would be absorbed by synchrotron self-absorption, high-frequency endof synchrotron emission can escape from a corona and appears at the sub-mmrange. If only thermal electrons exist in a corona, the expected flux fromnearby Seyferts is below the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array(ALMA) sensitivity. However, if non-thermal electrons coexist in a corona, ALMAcan measure the non-thermal tail of the synchrotron radiation from a corona.Such non-thermal population is naturally expected to exist if the corona isheated by magnetic reconnections. Future ALMA observations will directly probethe coronal magnetic field strength and the existence of non-thermal electronsin coronae of AGNs.
