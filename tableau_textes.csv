1	Hey all,   Yes, the name of our city bears resemblance to that of a deadly virus outbreak going on right now. While our city typically has nothing else to discuss, I must ask you to at least keep the posts relevant.   I am personally OK with users posting and discussing when major news breaks (I like to think of it as gossip). I am not OK with shallow jokes or irrelevant discussion.   If your post was/is removed, it was likely deemed off-topic or too similar to posts that already exist.   For those looking for the appropriate virus-related subreddit try /r/coronavirus or /r/COVID19 .   ***City residents - check out the City website link [here](https://www.coronaca.gov/i-want-to/learn-more-about/coronavirus) or in the sidebar for updates.***   -MartOut  EDIT: I have updated many things in an effort to reduce the bot spam. If you believe one of your posts was removed in error, please notify the mods and we will work with you to have your post approved.	Reddit
