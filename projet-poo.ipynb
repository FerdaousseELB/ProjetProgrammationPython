Czerny\tDate : 1995/05/10\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9505045v1\tTexte : We discuss a model for the central region of radio-quiet AGN in which coronalaccretion is the source of energy for X-ray emission. We start from the Haardt& Maraschi model but supplement it with pressure balance condition, twopossibilities of the angular momentum transfer and three models of thedisc-corona transition. We employ the alpha-description of viscosity within thetwo layers. Both descriptions of the angular momentum transport lead to similarconclusions about the fraction of energy liberated in the disc although theypredict strongly different properties of the disc interiors. The coupleddisc/corona system has one family of solutions at low accretion rates, twofamilies of solutions at intermediate accretion rates and no solution for highaccretion rate. Of the two families of solutions, the first one has weaklydissipating coronae and the second one has coronae which dominate energeticallythe system. The two solutions merge at sub-Eddington accretion rate because acorona in hydrostatic equilibrium can dissipate only a limited amount ofenergy, which depends on the viscosity parameter.\t\n",

Zycki\tDate : 1995/09/17\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9509085v1\tTexte : We study an accretion disc with a hot continuous corona. We assume that thecorona itself accretes and therefore it is powered directly by the release ofthe gravitational energy and cooled by radiative interaction with the disc. Weconsider the vertical structure of such a corona and show that the radialinfall is accompanied by strong vertical outflow. Such a model has twoimportant consequences: (i) at a given radius the corona forms only foraccretion rate larger than a limiting value and the fraction of energydissipated in the corona decreases with increasing accretion rate, and (ii) thedisc spectra are significantly softer in the optical/UV band in comparison withthe predictions of standard accretion discs due to the mass loss and thedecrease of internal dissipation in the disc. Both trends correspond well tothe mean spectra of radio quiet AGN and observed luminosity states in galacticblack hole candidates.\t\n",

Variations in theoptical depth tau of the corona cause spectral changes in the Comptonizedemission in the sense that the spectrum steepens and the temperature decreaseswith increasing tau. If the corona is pair dominated, tau is determined by thecompactness (proportional to luminosity for fixed size). This yields a definiterelation between spectral shape and intensity implying a variation in intensityof a factor 10 for a change of 0.2 in the 2-10 keV spectral index. For low pairdensity coronae, no definite prediction is possible. In the absence ofsubstantial changes in the structure of the corona, the soft thermal componentcorrelates with the medium-hard Comptonized component. Examples are computedusing the ROSAT response matrix, showing that current observations of NGC 5548and Mrk 766 showing different behaviours can be reconciled with the model. Thespectral behaviour of Mrk 766 strongly suggests that the coronal plasma in thissource is not pair dominated.\t\n",

Czerny\tDate : 1996/11/22\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9611187v1\tTexte : We study a model of an accretion disc surrounded by an extended corona of thetemperature 10^7 - 10^8 K. This corona modifies the disk spectrum since itredirects a significant fraction of the emission from the central parts towardsthe more distant parts of the disk. The same corona is indirectly the source ofthe broad emission lines because we expect the formation of cool clouds at thebasis of the corona due to thermal instabilities. We model the number of theclouds and their motion through the corona adopting a few different physicallysound assumptions. Comparing the predicted optical/UV continua and emissionline ratios and profiles with the observed values we favor a particular modelof a typical quasar. It radiates at ~0.5 of the Eddington luminosity, thecorona surrounding the disk is additionally heated in excess of the InverseCompton heating, and the broad line clouds are most probably destroyed whenaccelerated vertically above the sound speed within the corona.\t\n",

We assume that all of the dissipative heating takes place inthe corona. We find that the importance of conduction decreases with increasesin the local dissipative compactness of the corona, l_{diss,loc}, and increaseswith increasing abundance of electron-positron pairs. For l_{diss,loc} < 1, asignificant fraction of the energy released in the corona may be carried awayby the conductive flux, leading to formation of a relatively hot transitionlayer below the base of the corona. Comptonization of disk radiation in such alayer may account for the presence of soft X-ray excesses in the spectraemitted by disk-corona systems.\t\n",

Esin\tDate : 1999/01/08\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9901078v1\tTexte : We investigate equilibrium accretion flows dominated by $e^+ e^-$ pairs. Weconsider one- and two-temperature accretion disk coronae above a thin disk, aswell as hot optically thin two-temperature accretion flows without anunderlying thin disk; we model the latter in the framework ofadvection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). In all three cases we includeequipartition magnetic fields. We confirm the previous result that theequilibrium density of pairs in two-temperature ADAFs is negligible; and showthat the inclusion of magnetic fields and the corresponding synchrotron coolingreduces the pair density even further. Similarly, we find that pairs areunimportant in two-temperature coronae. Even when the corona has significantlyenhanced heating by direct transfer of viscous dissipation in the thin disk tothe corona, the inefficient Coulomb coupling between protons and electrons actsas a bottleneck and prevents the high compactness required for pair-dominatedsolutions. Only in the case of a one-temperature corona model do we findpair-dominated thermal equilibria. These pair-dominated solutions occur over alimited range of optical depth and temperature.\t\n",

In this model the fraction of theenergy liberated in the corona at a given radius is calculated from the globalparameters of the model (mass of the central object, accretion rate andviscosity parameter) and it appears to be a strong function of the radius. Themodel predicts the relative decrease of the coronal hard X-ray emission with anincrease of the accretion rate.

Fabian\tDate : 2000/09/29\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009498v1\tTexte : Most astrophysical sources powered by accretion onto a black hole, either ofstellar mass or supermassive, when observed with hard X-rays show signs of ahot Comptonizing component in the flow, the so-called corona, with observedtemperatures and optical depths lying in a narrow range (0.1 < \\tau < 1 and1x10^9 K < T < 3x10^9 K). Here we argue that these facts constitute strongsupporting evidence for a magnetically-dominated corona. We show that theinferred thermal energy content of the corona, in all black hole systems, isfar too low to explain their observed hard X-ray luminosities, unless eitherthe size of the corona is at least of the order of 10^3 Schwarzschild radii, orthe corona itself is in fact a reservoir, where the energy is mainly stored inthe form of a magnetic field generated by a sheared rotator (probably theaccretion disc). We briefly outline the main reasons why the former possibilityis to be discarded, and the latter preferred.\t\n",
      "Titre : The effect of dissipative corona on the structure and stability of cold  optically thick accretion disks at high accretion rates\tAuteur : Ranjeev Misra, R. E. Taam\tDate : 2002/03/20\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0203332v1\tTexte : The vertical structure of optically thick accretion disks is investigated inthe two-zone approximation. The disk is divided into an underlying disk and acorona, where the latter is defined as the upper surface layers for which theeffective optical depth is unity. It is found that a significant part of theaccretion flow (or dissipation rate) can take place in the corona if the scaleheight of the magnetic field is larger than that of the disk. The presence ofsuch a dissipative corona leads to a modification in the topology of local disksolutions. For example, these solutions are found from local stability analysisto be both secularly and thermally stable, for accretion rates which are afactor $\\approx$ four higher than those inferred from the stability of standarddisk solutions. Thus, the applicability of optically thick disks withdissipative coronas are not as restrictive as disks without such coronas andcan provide an attractive explanation for the origin of the soft spectralcomponent observed in black hole X-ray binary systems.\t\n",

When the disc-coronacoupling is accounted for self-consistently assuming that magneto-rotationalinstability is at work in the disc, and that the corona is generated by buoyantescape of disc magnetic structures, then the model predicts powerful, X-rayemitting coronae at low accretion rates. A main consequence is discussed: thepossibility that the corona itself is the launching site of powerful, MHDdriven jets/outflows. This depends crucially of the coronal scaleheight.Finally, we present the first radial profiles of a corona a different accretionrates, and discuss their implications for high frequency variability.\t\n",

Nan Zhang, Xiaoling Zhang, Yuxin Feng, Craig R. Robinson\tDate : 2003/03/24\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0303535v3\tTexte : Understanding the properties of the hot corona is important for studying theaccretion disks in black hole X-ray binary systems. Using the Monte-Carlotechnique to simulate the inverse Compton scattering between photons emittedfrom the cold disk and electrons in the hot corona, we have produced two tablemodels in the $XSPEC$ format for the spherical corona case and the disk-like(slab) corona case. All parameters in our table models are physical propertiesof the system and can be derived from data fitting directly. Applying themodels to broad-band spectra of the black hole candidate XTE J2012+381 observedwith BeppoSAX, we estimated the size of the corona and the inner radius of thedisk. The size of the corona in this system is several tens of gravitationalradius, and the substantial increase of the inner disk radius during thetransit from hard-state to soft-state is not found.\t\n",

Jones, S. S. Murray\tDate : 2004/08/24\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0408425v1\tTexte : A new Chandra observation of the northwest region of the galaxy cluster A1367reveals four cool galaxy coronae (0.4 - 1.0 keV) embedded in the hotintracluster medium (ICM) (5 - 6 keV). While the large coronae of NGC 3842 andNGC 3837 appear symmetric and relaxed, the galaxy coronae of the $\\lsim$ L*galaxies (NGC 3841 and CGCG 97090) are disturbed and being stripped. Massivegalaxies, with dense cooling cores, are better able to resist ram pressurestripping and survive in rich environments than $\\lsim$ L* galaxies whosegalactic coronae are much less dense. The survival of these cool coronaeimplies that thermal conduction from the hot surrounding ICM has to besuppressed by a factor of at least 60, at the corona boundary. Within thegalaxy coronae of NGC 3842 and NGC 3837, stellar mass loss or heat conductionwith the Spitzer value may be sufficient to balance radiative cooling. Energydeposition at the ends of collimated jets may heat the outer coronae, but allowthe survival of a small, dense gas core (e.g., NGC 3842 in A1367 and NGC 4874in Coma). The survived X-ray coronae become significantly smaller and fainterwith the increasing ambient pressure.\t\n",
      "Titre : A small X-ray corona of the narrow-angle tail radio galaxy NGC 1265  soaring through the Perseus cluster\tAuteur : M. Sun, D. Jerius, C. Jones\tDate : 2005/01/24\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0501501v2\tTexte : A deep Chandra observation of NGC 1265 (3C 83.1B), the prototype for thenarrow-angled-tailed (NAT) radio galaxy, reveals a small cool X-ray thermalcorona (~ 0.6 keV) embedded in the hot ICM of the Perseus cluster (~ 6.7 keV).The corona is asymmetric with a sharp edge (~ 2.2'', or 0.8 kpc from thenucleus) to the south and an extension to the north (at least ~ 8'' from thenucleus), which is interpreted as the action of ram pressure while solely thestatic ICM confinement is unable to explain. We estimate that the corona ismoving with a velocity of ~ 2.4 - 4.2 times the local sound speed to the south.The presence of the sharp edge for this small corona indicates that thetransport processes are largely suppressed by the magnetic field there. Themagnetic field around the corona also suppresses heat conduction by at least afactor of ~ 60 across the corona boundary. We conclude that it is unrealisticto study the interaction of the small X-ray coronae with the hot ICM withoutthe consideration of the roles that magnetic field plays, a factor not includedin current simulations. An absorbed (N_H=1.5-3x10^22 cm^-2) nucleus is alsodetected, which is not usual for FR I radio galaxies. Weak X-ray emission fromthree inner radio knots in the jets is also detected. Indentations at the eastand west of the corona indicate interaction between the jets and the X-raycorona. Narrow jets carry great amounts of energy out of the central AGN andrelease the energy outside the corona, preserving the tiny and vulnerablecorona. This case reveals that the inner kpc core of the corona of massivegalaxies can survive both high-speed stripping and powerful AGN feedback. Thus,the cooling of the X-ray coronae potentially provides fuel to the central SMBHin rich environments where the amount of the galactic cold gas is at a minimum.\t\n",

Building on that previous study weexplore the impact of magnetic configurations in the photosphere and the lowcorona on the magnetic connectivity from the network to the corona.Observational studies of this connectivity are often utilizing magnetic fieldextrapolations. However, it is open to which extent such extrapolations reallyrepresent the connectivity found on the Sun, as observations are not able toresolve all fine scale magnetic structures. The present numerical experimentsaim at contributing to this question. We investigated randomsalt-and-pepper-type distributions of kilo-Gauss internetwork flux elementscarrying some $10^{15}$ to $10^{17}$ Mx, which are hardly distinguishable bycurrent observational techniques. These photospheric distributions are thenextrapolated into the corona using different sets of boundary conditions at thebottom and the top. This allows us to investigate the fraction of network fluxwhich is connected to the corona, as well as the locations of those coronalregions which are connected to the network patches. We find that with currentinstrumentation one cannot really determine from observations, which regions onthe quiet Sun surface, i.e. in the network and internetwork, are connected towhich parts of the corona through extrapolation techniques. Futurespectro-polarimetric instruments, such as with Solar B or GREGOR, will providea higher sensitivity, and studies like the present one could help to estimateto which extent one can then pinpoint the connection from the chromosphere tothe corona.\t\n",

Czerny\tDate : 2007/02/26\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0702688v1\tTexte : We develop a two-flow model of accretion onto a black hole which incorporatesthe effect of the local magneto-rotational instability. The flow consists of anaccretion disk and an accreting corona, and the local dynamo affects thedisk/corona mass exchange. The model is aimed to explain the power spectrumdensity of the sources in their soft, disk-dominated states. The localperturbations of the magnetic field in the disk are described as in King et al.(2004) and Mayer and Pringle (2005), but the time-dependent local magneticfield is assumed to affect the local supply of the material to the corona.Since the viscous timescale in the corona is much shorter than in the disk, thelocal perturbations are not smeared in the corona. Simple analytical estimatesand full time-dependent computations of the disk-corona system are performed.The accreting corona model can reproduce the broad power spectra of Soft StateX-ray binaries and AGN. The model, however, predicts that (i) sourcesundergoing radiation pressure instability (GRS 1915+105) should havesystematically steeper power spectra than other sources, (ii) AGN should havesystematically steeper power spectra than GBH, even if their disks aredescribed using viscosity proportional to the gas pressure. More precisemeasurements of power spectra of Soft State sources are clearly needed.\t\n",

Assuming that themagneto-rotational-instability (MRI) responsible for generating the turbulentstresses inside the disc is also the source for a magnetically dominatedcorona, a fraction of the power released when the disc matter accretes istransported to and dissipated in the corona. This has major effect on thestructure of the disc and its gravitational (in)stability according to ouranalytical and self-consistent solutions. We determine the radius where thedisc crosses the inner radius of gravitational instability and forms the firststars. Not only the location of this radius which may extend to very largedistances from the central black hole, but also the mass of the first starshighly depends on the input parameters, notably the viscous coefficient, massof the central object and the accretion rate. For accretion discs aroundquasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and the Galactic center, we determine theself-gravitating radius and the mass of the first clumps. Comparing the caseswith a corona and without a corona for typical discs around QSOs or theGalactic center, when the viscosity coefficient is around 0.3, we show that theself-gravitating radius decreases by a factor of approximately 2, but the massof the fragments increases with more or less the same factor. Existence of acorona implies a more gravitationally unstable disc according to our results.The effect of a corona on the instability of the disc is more effective whenthe viscosity coefficient increases.\t\n",

The mechanisms atwork in this so called Compton corona can be unveiled through hard X-rayobservations which have revealed a rich phenomenology. Depending on luminositydifferent spectral states are observed suggesting that the nature and geometryof the corona depends on mass accretion rate. In many instances the spectralbehaviour as a function of luminosity shows some degree of hysteresis. Themechanisms triggering the transition between spectral states is very unclearalthough it could be related to an evaporation/condensation equilibrium in anaccretion disc corona system. From the observation of correlation between theX-ray and radio band, it appears that the Compton corona is intimately relatedto the formation of compact jets and probably constitutes the base of the jet.\t\n",

We assume that themagneto-rotational instability is the dominant mechanism of angular momentumtransport inside the disc and is responsible for producing magnetic tubes abovethe disc. In our model, a fraction of the dissipated energy inside the disc istransported to the corona via these magnetic tubes. This energy exchange fromthe disc to the corona which depends on the disc physical properties ismodified because of the magnetic interaction between the stellar magnetic fieldand the accretion disc. According to our fully analytical solutions for such asystem, the existence of a corona not only increases the surface density butreduces the temperature of the accretion disc. Also, the presence of a coronaenhances the ratio of gas pressure to the total pressure. Our solutions showthat when the strength of the magnetic field of the central neutron star islarge or the star is rotating fast enough, profiles of the physical variablesof the disc significantly modify due to the existence of a corona.\t\n",

For the energy exchange between the disc and the corona, weassume a fraction f of the dissipated energy inside the accretion disc istransported to the corona via the magnetic tubes. Analytical solutionscorresponding to a prescription for f (in which this parameter directly dependson the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure) or free f are presentedand their physical properties are studied in detail. We show that the existenceof the corona not only decreases the temperature of the disc, but alsoincreases the surface density.The vertical component of the gravitational forcedue to the self-gravity of the disc decreases the self-gravitating radius andthe mass of the fragments at this radius. However, as more energy istransported from the disc to the corona, the effect of the vertical componentof the gravitational force due to the self-gravity of the disc on theself-gravitating radius becomes weaker, though the mass of the fragments isreduced irrespective of the amount of the energy exchange from the disc to thecorona.\t\n",

The hard X-rayspectral index is found to be correlated with the Eddington ratio, and the hardX-ray bolometric correction factor L_bol/L_x increases with the Eddingtonratio. The Compton reflection is also found to be correlated with the hardX-ray spectral index. These observational features provide very usefulconstraints on the accretion disc-corona model for AGN. We construct anaccretion disc-corona model and calculate the spectra with different magneticstress tensors in the cold discs, in which the corona is assumed to be heatedby the reconnection of the magnetic fields generated by buoyancy instability inthe cold accretion disc. Our calculations show that the magnetic stress tensor\\alpha p_gas fails to explain all these observational features, while \\alphap_tot always leads to constant L_bol/L_x independent of the Eddington ratio.The resulted spectra of the disc-corona systems with \\alpha (p_gas p_tot)^1/2show that both the hard X-ray spectral index and the hard X-ray bolometriccorrection factor L_bol/L_x increase with the Eddington ratio, which arequalitatively consistent with the observations. We find that the disc-coronamodel is unable to reproduce the observed very hard X-ray continuum emissionfrom the sources accreting at low rates, which may imply the differentaccretion mode in these low luminosity sources. We suggest that the disc-coronasystem transits to an advection-dominated accretion flow+disc corona system atlow accretion rates, which may be able to explain all the above-mentionedcorrelations.\t\n",

We drive the simulation with surface maps forthe radial magnetic field obtained from a stellar dynamo model of the FK Comsystem. This enables us to obtain the coronal structure for different fieldtopologies representing different periods of time. We find that the corona ofsuch an FK Com-like star, including the large scale coronal loops, is dominatedby a strong toroidal component of the magnetic field. This is a result of partof the field being dragged by the radial outflow, while the other part remainsattached to the rapidly rotating stellar surface. This tangling of the magneticfield,in addition to a reduction in the radial flow component, leads to aflattening of the gas density profile with distance in the inner part of thecorona. The three-dimensional simulation provides a global view of the coronalstructure. Some aspects of the results, such as the toroidal wrapping of themagnetic field, should also be applicable to coronae on fast rotators ingeneral, which our study shows can be considerably different from thewell-studied and well-observed solar corona. Studying the global structure ofsuch coronae should also lead to a better understanding of their relatedstellar processes, such as flares and coronal mass ejections, and inparticular, should lead to an improved understanding of mass and angularmomentum loss from such systems.\t\n",

We solve the 3D MHD problem numerically ina box representing part of the (solar) corona. The energy balance includesSpitzer heat conduction along the magnetic field and optically thin radiativelosses. The self-consistent heating mechanism is based on the braiding ofmagnetic field lines rooted in the convective photosphere. Magnetic stressinduced by photospheric motions leads to currents in the atmosphere which heatthe corona through Ohmic dissipation. While the horizontally averagedquantities, such as heating rate, temperature or density, are relativelyconstant in time, the simulated corona is highly variable and dynamic, onaverage reaching temperatures and densities as found in observations. Thestrongest heating per particle is found in the transition region from thechromosphere to the corona. The heating is concentrated in current sheetsroughly aligned with the magnetic field and is transient in time and space.This supports the idea that numerous small heating events heat the corona,often referred to a nanoflares.\t\n",

Acoloring related property of a graphs is also an assignment of colors or labelsto the vertices of a graph, in which the process of labeling is done accordingto an extra condition. A set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is a dominating setin $G$ if every vertex outside of $S$ is adjacent to at least one vertexbelonging to $S$. A domination parameter of $G$ is related to those structuresof a graph satisfying some domination property together with other conditionson the vertices of $G$.

Based on this model, the thin disk canextend down to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) at accretion rateshigher than $0.02\\dot{M}_{\\rm Edd}$; while the corona is weak since part of thecoronal gas is cooled by strong inverse Compton scattering of the disk photons.This implies that the corona cannot produce as strong X-ray radiation asobserved in HLAGNs with large Eddington ratio. In addition to the viscousheating, other heating to the corona is necessary to interpret HLAGN. In thispaper, we assume that a part of accretion energy released in the disk istransported into the corona, heating up the electrons and thereby radiatedaway. We for the first time, compute the corona structure with additionalheating, taking fully into account the mass supply to the corona and find thatthe corona could indeed survive at higher accretion rates and its radiationpower increases. The spectra composed of bremsstrahlung and Compton radiationare also calculated. Our calculations show that the Compton dominated spectrumbecomes harder with the increase of energy fraction ($f$) liberating in thecorona, and the photon index for hard X-ray($2-10 \\rm keV$) is $2.2 < \\Gamma <2.7 $. We discuss possible heating mechanisms for the corona. Combining theenergy fraction transported to the corona with the accretion rate by magneticheating, we find that the hard X-ray spectrum becomes steeper at largeraccretion rate and the bolometric correction factor ($L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rm2-10keV}$) increases with increasing accretion rate for $f<8/35$, which isroughly consistent with the observational results.\t\n",

The emergent spectra ofthe accretion disk-corona systems are calculated by using the relativisticray-tracing method. We propose a new method to calculate the emergentComptonized spectra from the coronae. The spectra of the disk-corona systemswith a modified $\\alpha$-magnetic stress show that both the hard X-ray spectralindex and the hard X-ray bolometric correction factor $L_{\\rm bol}/L_{\\rmX,2-10keV}$ increase with the dimensionless mass accretion rate, which arequalitatively consistent with the observations of active galactic nuclei(AGNs). The fraction of the power dissipated in the corona decreases withincreasing black hole spin parameter $a$, which leads to lower electrontemperatures of the coronas for rapidly spinning black holes. The X-rayemission from the coronas surrounding rapidly spinning black holes becomes weakand soft. The ratio of the X-ray luminosity to the optical/UV luminosityincreases with the viewing angle, while the spectral shape in the X-ray band isinsensitive with the viewing angle. We find that the spectral index in theinfrared waveband depends on the mass accretion rate and the black hole spin$a$, which deviates from $f_\\nu\\propto\\nu^{1/3}$ expected by the standard thindisk model.\t\n",

One possible mechanism is magnetic reconnectionheating requiring energy equipartition between magnetic energy and gas energyin the disk. Here, we investigate the expected observed properties in radioband from such a magnetized corona. A magnetized corona can generatesynchrotron radiation since a huge amount of electrons exists. Although most ofradiation would be absorbed by synchrotron self-absorption, high-frequency endof synchrotron emission can escape from a corona and appears at the sub-mmrange. If only thermal electrons exist in a corona, the expected flux fromnearby Seyferts is below the Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array(ALMA) sensitivity. However, if non-thermal electrons coexist in a corona, ALMAcan measure the non-thermal tail of the synchrotron radiation from a corona.Such non-thermal population is naturally expected to exist if the corona isheated by magnetic reconnections.

Gallo\tDate : 2015/01/21\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05302v1\tTexte : Variations in the X-ray emission from the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy,Markarian 335 (Mrk 335), are studied on both long and short timescales throughobservations made between 2006 and 2013 with XMM-Newton, Suzaku and NuSTAR.Changes in the geometry and energetics of the corona that give rise to thisvariability are inferred through measurements of the relativistically blurredreflection seen from the accretion disc. On long timescales, we find thatduring the high flux epochs the corona has expanded, covering the inner regionsof the accretion disc out to a radius of 26(-7,+10)rg. The corona contracts towithin 12rg and 5rg in the intermediate and low flux epochs, respectively.While the earlier high flux observation made in 2006 is consistent with acorona extending over the inner part of the accretion disc, a later high fluxobservation that year revealed that the X-ray source had become collimated intoa vertically-extended jet-like corona and suggested relativistic motion ofmaterial upward. On short timescales, we find that an X-ray flare during a lowflux epoch in 2013 corresponded to a reconfiguration from a slightly extendedcorona to one much more compact, within just 2~3rg of the black hole. There isevidence that during the flare itself, the spectrum softened and the coronabecame collimated and slightly extended vertically as if a jet-launching eventwas aborted. Understanding the evolution of the X-ray emitting corona mayreveal the underlying mechanism by which the luminous X-ray sources in AGN arepowered.\t\n",

Petrucci\tDate : 2015/04/13\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03160v2\tTexte : In the past years, several observations of AGN and X-ray binaries havesuggested the existence of a warm T around 0.5-1 keV and optically thick, \\tau~ 10-20, corona covering the inner parts of the accretion disk. Theseproperties are directly derived from spectral fitting in UV to soft-X-raysusing Comptonization models. However, whether such a medium can be both inradiative and hydrostatic equilibrium with an accretion disk is stilluncertain. We investigate the properties of such warm, optically thick coronaeand put constraints on their existence. We solve the radiative transferequation for grey atmosphere analytically in a pure scattering medium,including local dissipation as an additional heating term in the warm corona.The temperature profile of the warm corona is calculated assuming it is cooledby Compton scattering, with the underlying dissipative disk providing photonsto the corona. Our analytic calculations show that a dissipative thick,(\\tau_{cor} ~ 10-12) corona on the top of a standard accretion disk can reachtemperatures of the order of 0.5-1 keV in its upper layers provided that thedisk is passive. But, in absence of strong magnetic fields, the requirement ofa Compton cooled corona in hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical directionsets an upper limit on the Thomson optical depth \\tau_{cor} < 5 . We show thisvalue cannot be exceeded independently of the accretion disk parameters.However, magnetic pressure can extend this result to larger optical depths.Namely, a dissipative corona might have an optical depth up to ~ 20 when themagnetic pressure is 100 times higher that the gas pressure. The observation ofwarm coronae with Thomson depth larger than ~ 5 puts tights constraints on thephysics of the accretion disk/corona systems and requires either strongmagnetic fields or vertical outflows to stabilize the system.\t\n",

Frazin, Julien Wojak\tDate : 2016/07/21\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06308v1\tTexte : Solar rotational tomography (SRT) applied to white-light coronal imagesobserved at multiple aspect angles has been the preferred approach fordetermining the three-dimensional (3D) electron density structure of the solarcorona. However, it is seriously hampered by the restrictive assumption thatthe corona is time-invariant which introduces significant errors in thereconstruction. We first explore several methods to mitigate the temporalvariation of the corona by decoupling the \"fast-varying\" inner corona from the\"slow-moving\" outer corona using multiple masking (either by juxtaposition orrecursive combination) and radial weighting. Weighting with a radialexponential profile provides some improvement over a classical reconstructionbut only beyond 3 Rsun. We next consider a full time-dependent tomographicreconstruction involving spatio-temporal regularization and further introduce aco-rotating regularization aimed at preventing concentration of reconstructeddensity in the plane of the sky. Crucial to testing our procedure and properlytuning the regularization parameters is the introduction of a time-dependentMHD model of the corona based on observed magnetograms to build a time-seriesof synthetic images of the corona. Our procedure, which successfully reproducesthe time-varying model corona, is finally applied to a set of of 53 LASCO-C2 pBimages roughly evenly spaced in time from 15 to 29 March 2009. Our procedurepaves the way to a time-dependent tomographic reconstruction of the coronalelectron density to the whole set of LASCO-C2 images presently spanning 20years.\t\n",

Taam, Erlin Qiao, Weimin Yuan\tDate : 2017/09/28\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09799v1\tTexte : The X-ray emission from bright active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is believed tooriginate in a hot corona lying above a cold, geometrically thin accretiondisk. A highly concentrated corona located within $\\sim10$ gravitational radiiabove the black hole is inferred from observations. Based on the accretion ofinterstellar medium/wind, a disk corona model has been proposed in which thecorona is well coupled to the disk by radiation, thermal conduction, as well asby mass exchange \\citep{Liu2015, Qiao2017}. Such a model avoids artificialenergy input to the corona and has been used to interpret the spectral featuresobserved in AGN. In this work, it is shown that the bulk emission size of thecorona is very small for the extended accretion flow in our model. More than80\\% of the hard X-ray power is emitted from a small region confined within 10Schwarzschild radii around a non-spinning black hole, which is expected to beeven smaller accordingly for a spinning black hole. Here, the corona emissionis more extended at higher Eddington ratios. The compactness parameter of thecorona, $l={L\\over R}{\\sigma_{\\rm T}\\over m_{\\rm e} c^3}$, is shown to be inthe range of 1-33 for Eddington ratios of 0.02 - 0.1. Combined with theelectron temperature in the corona, this indicates that electron--positron pairproduction is not dominant in this regime. A positive relation between thecompactness parameter and photon index is also predicted. By comparing theabove model predictions with observational features, we find that the model isin agreement with observations.\t\n",

In our model, we consider the gas heating by magneto-rotationalinstability (MRI) dynamo. Our goal is to show that the proper calculation ofthe gas heating by magnetic dynamo can build up the warm, optically thickcorona above the accretion disk around black hole of stellar mass. Usingvertical model of the disk supported and heated by the magnetic field togetherwith radiative transfer in hydrostatic and radiative equilibrium we developedrelaxation numerical scheme which allows us to compute the transition form thedisk to corona in a self consistent way. We demonstrate here that the warm (upto 5 keV), optically thick (up to 10 Thompson optical depths), Compton cooledcorona can form due to the magnetic heating. Such warm corona is stronger forhigher accretion rate and larger magnetic field strength. The radial extent ofthe warm corona is limited by the occurrence of the local thermal instability,which purely depends on radiative processes. The obtained coronal parametersare in agreement with those constrained from X-ray observations. The warmmagnetically supported corona is tends to appear in the inner disk regions. Itmay be responsible for Soft X-ray excess seen in accreting sources. For loweraccretion rates and weaker magnetic field parameters, thermal instabilityprevents warm corona to exist, giving rise to eventual clumpiness or ionizedoutflow.\t\n",

Its emissionilluminates the inner accretion disc, creating the atomic line-rich reflectionspectrum used to diagnose and map the accretion flow and measure black holespin. The corona is likely powered magnetically by the strong differentialrotation of the accretion disc and it may be intimately related to relativisticjets. Recent work shows that many black hole coronae may be dominated byelectron-positron pairs produced by photon-photon collisions in the compactcoronal environment. Despite the corona being an integral component of AGN andblack hole binary systems, much is still unknown about the nature of thecorona, such as its geometry, location, and the physical mechanisms poweringthe emission. In this white paper we explore our current understanding ofcoronal properties, such as its temperature, obtained from measurements withexisting hard X-ray telescopes such as NuSTAR, and discuss important questionsto be addressed in the coming decade surrounding the nature of the corona. HardX-ray observations will continue to dispel the mystery of coronae and open upthis part of the quasar engine to full understanding.\t\n",

Dov\\v{c}iak & Done (2016) proposed a method based on calculationsassuming a point-like lamp-post corona. To perform more self-consistentcalculations of energy spectra of extended coronae, we develop monk, a MonteCarlo radiative transfer code dedicated to calculations of Comptonised spectrain the Kerr spacetime. In monk we assume Klein-Nishina scattering cross sectionand include all general relativistic effects. We find that for a corona locatedabove the disc, the spectrum is not isotropic, but with harder and lessluminous spectra towards observers at lower inclinations, owing to anisotropicillumination of the seed photons. This anisotropy also leads to anunderestimated size of the corona if we assume the corona to be a point-like,isotropic source located on the black hole rotation axis, demonstrating thenecessity of more self-consistent calculations. We also inspect the effect ofmotion and geometry of the corona on the emergent spectrum. Finally, we discussthe implication of anisotropic corona emission for the reflection spectrum inAGNs as well as black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs). We find that by assumingthe corona emission to be isotropic, one may underestimate the soft excess inAGNs and the reflection continuum and iron K fluorescent line flux in BHXRBs.\t\n",

To analyze the electricfield as well as the ion flow (space charge) distribution under DC coronadischarges, the ion flow model has been widely adopted; Kaptzov's assumption,which states the {steady state} electric field at the conductor surface remainsat the corona onset value, serves as a boundary condition. In this letter, weinvestigate the electric field distribution under DC corona discharges betweencoaxial cylindrical electrodes in ambient air by electric field induced secondharmonic generation with nano-second pulse laser beams. The electric fielddistribution (with or without corona discharge) is obtained. By comparing themeasurements with the results predicted by the ion flow model for negativecorona discharge, it is found that the electric field at the conductor surfaceis proportional to the current density of the corona discharge with a negativeconstant of proportionality. Therefore, for negative corona discharges,Kaptzov's assumption is valid only when the discharge current approaches zeroor is small.\t\n",

Using optical,electron and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), we determine the pulmonarysurfactant corona structure at different scales of observation. Contrary tocommon belief, the PS corona is not only constituted by phospholipidic bilayerssurrounding NPs but by multiple hybrid structures derived from NPs-vesiclesinteraction.

By combining with thereflection spectrum, warm coronae may be responsible for producing the smoothsoft excess seen in AGN X-ray spectra. This paper studies how a warm coronamust adjust in order to sustain the soft excess through large changes in theAGN flux. Spectra from one-dimensional constant density and hydrostatic warmcoronae models are calculated assuming the illuminating hard X-ray power-law,gas density, Thomson depth and coronal heating strength vary in response tochanges in the accretion rate. We identify models that produce warm coronaewith temperatures between $0.3$ and $1.1$ keV, and measure the photon indicesand emitted fluxes in the $0.5$-$2$ keV and $2$-$10$ keV bands. Correlationsand anti-correlations between these quantities depend on the evolution andstructure of the warm corona. Tracing the path that an AGN follows throughthese correlations will constrain how warm coronae are heated and connected tothe accretion disc. Variations in the density structure and coronal heatingstrength of warm coronae will lead to a variety of soft excess strengths andshapes in AGNs. A larger accretion rate will, on average, lead to a warm coronathat produces a stronger soft excess, consistent with observations of localSeyfert galaxies.\t\n",

Todetermine the spectra of the adjacency, Laplacian and the signless Laplacianmatrices of the above mentioned graphs, we define a notion namely, the coronalof a matrix constrained by an index set, which generalizes the coronal of agraph matrix. Then we prove several results pertain to the determination ofthis value. Then we determine the characteristic polynomials of the adjacencyand the Laplacian matrices of this graph in terms of the characteristicpolynomials of the adjacency and the Laplacian matrices of the constituentgraphs and the coronal of some matrices related to the constituent graphs.Using these, we derive the characteristic polynomials of the adjacency and theLaplacian matrices of the above mentioned existing variants of corona ofgraphs, and some more variants of corona of graphs with some specialconstraints.\t\n",

Lobaskin\tDate : 2021/04/28\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13699v1\tTexte : A nanoparticle (NP) immersed in biological media rapidly forms a corona ofadsorbed proteins, which later controls the eventual fate of the particle andthe route through which adverse outcomes may occur. The composition andtimescale for the formation of this corona are both highly dependent on boththe NP and its environment. The deposition of proteins on the surface of the NPis related to processes of random sequential adsorption and, based on thismodel, we develop a rate-equation treatment for the formation of a coronarepresented by hard spheres on spherical and cylindrical NPs. We find that thegeometry of the NP significantly alters the composition of the corona through aprocess independent of the rate constants assumed for adsorption and desorptionof proteins, with the radius and shape of the NP both influencing the corona.Moreover, we demonstrate that in the condition of strong binding such that theadsorption is effectively irreversible the corona content reflects the proteinmobility and concentration in solution rather than their binding affinity.\t\n",

Using DCCI2,we investigate effects of interplay between locally equilibrated andnon-equilibrated systems, in other words, core and corona components inhigh-energy nuclear collisions. Given experimental multiplicity distributionsand yield ratios of $\\Omega$ baryons to charged pions as inputs, we extract thefraction of core and corona components in p+p collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeVand Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. We find core contributionovertakes corona contribution as increasing multiplicity above $\\langledN_{\\mathrm{ch}}/d\\eta \\rangle_{|\\eta|<0.5} \\sim 18$ regardless of thecollision system or energy. We also see that the core contribution exceeds thecorona contribution only in 0.0-0.95\\% multiplicity class in p+p collisions.Notably, there is a small enhancement of corona contribution with $\\sim20$\\%below $p_T\\sim 1$ GeV even in minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions. We find that thecorona contribution at low $p_T$ gives $\\sim 15$-$38$ $\\%$ correction on$v_2\\{2\\}$ at $N_{\\mathrm{ch}}\\lesssim 370$. This raises a problem inconventional hydrodynamic analyses in which low $p_T$ soft hadrons originatesolely from core components.

Auernhammer\tDate : 2021/11/16\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08544v1\tTexte : Environmental fate and toxicity of microplastic particles is dominated bytheir surface properties. In the environment an adsorbed layer of biomoleculesand natural organic matter forms the so-called eco-corona. A quantitativedescription of how this eco-corona changes the particles' colloidalinteractions is still missing. Here, we demonstrate with colloidal probe-atomicforce microscopy that the formation of the eco-corona on microplastic particlesintroduces a soft film on the surface which changes the mechanical behaviour.We measure single particle-particle interactions and find a pronounced increaseof long-range repulsive interactions upon eco-corona formation. Theseforce-distance characteristics follow well the polymer brush model by Alexanderand de Gennes. We further compare the obtained fitting parameters to knownsystems like polyelectrolyte multilayers and propose these as a model systemfor the eco-corona. The foundation of the eco-corona interacting like a polymerbrush with its surrounding may help understand microplastic transport andaggregation in the environment.\t\n",

We have compiled a catalog of 393 members of Corona Australis, (39 at>M6), 293 (36) of which are spectroscopically classified for the first time inthis work. We find that Corona Australis can be described in terms of twostellar populations, a younger one (few Myr) that is partially embedded in thecloud (the Coronet Cluster) and an older one (~15 Myr) that surrounds andextends beyond the cloud (Upper Corona Australis). These populations exhibitsimilar space velocities, and we find no evidence for distinct kinematicpopulations in Corona Australis, in contrast to a recent study based on GaiaDR2. The distribution of spectral types in Corona Australis reaches a maximumat M5 (~0.15 M_sol), indicating that the IMF has a similar characteristic massas other nearby star-forming regions. Finally, we have compiled mid-infraredphotometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the Spitzer SpaceTelescope for the members of Corona Australis and we have used those data toidentify and classify their circumstellar disks. Excesses are detected for 122stars, a third of which are reported for the first time in this work.\t\n",

The Warm Corona and Relativistic Reflection models are twomain scenarios to interpret the soft X-ray excess in AGNs at present. We usethe simultaneous X-ray observation data of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR on Sep. 24th,2016 to perform spectral analysis in two steps. First, we analyze thetime-average spectra by using Warm Corona and Relativistic Reflection models.Moreover, we also explore the Hybrid model, Double Reflection model and DoubleWarm Corona model. We find that both of Warm Corona and Relativistic Reflectionmodels can interpret the time-average spectra well but cannot be distinguishedeasily based on the time-averaged spectra fit statistics. Second, we add theRMS and covariance spectra to perform the spectral analysis with time-averagespectra. The result shows that the warm corona could reproduce all of thesespectra well. The the hot, optical thin corona and neutral distant reflectionwill increase their contribution with the temporal frequency, meaning that thecorona responsible for X-ray continuum comes from the inner compact X-rayregion and the neutral distant reflection is made of some moderate scaleneutral clumps.\t\n",

Zhang\tDate : 2021/12/21\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11268v1\tTexte : X-ray polarimetry can potentially constrain the unknown geometrical shape ofAGN coronae. We present simulations of the X-ray polarization signal expectedfrom AGN coronae, assuming three different geometries, namely slab, sphericaland conical. We use the fully relativistic Monte-Carlo Comptonization code monkto compute the X-ray polarization degree and angle. We explore differentcoronal parameters such as shape, size, location and optical depth. Differentcoronal geometries give a significantly different X-ray polarization signal. Aslab corona yields a high polarization degree, up to 14% depending on theviewing inclination; a spherical corona yields low values, about 1-3%, while aconical corona yields intermediate values. We also find a difference of 90degrees in polarization angle between the slab corona and the spherical orconical coronae. Upcoming X-ray polarimetry missions like IXPE will allow us toobservationally distinguish among different coronal geometries in AGNs for thefirst time.\t\n",

Thepotential of 800,000+ declassified Corona images has not been leveraged due tothe complexities arising from handling of panoramic imaging geometry, filmdistortions and limited availability of the metadata required forgeoreferencing of the Corona imagery. This paper presents Corona StereoPipeline (CoSP): A pipeline for processing of Corona KH-4 stereo panoramicimagery. CoSP utlizes a deep learning based feature matcher SuperGlue toautomatically match features point between Corona KH-4 images and recentsatellite imagery to generate Ground Control Points (GCPs). To model theimaging geometry and the scanning motion of the panoramic KH-4 cameras, arigorous camera model consisting of modified collinearity equations with timedependent exterior orientation parameters is employed. The results show thatusing the entire frame of the Corona image, bundle adjustment usingwell-distributed GCPs results in an average standard deviation (SD) of lessthan 2 pixels. The distortion pattern of image residuals of GCPs and y-parallaxin epipolar resampled images suggest that film distortions due to long termstorage as likely cause of systematic deviations. Compared to the SRTM DEM, theCorona DEM computed using CoSP achieved a Normalized Median Absolute Deviation(NMAD) of elevation differences of ~4 m over an area of approx. 4000 $km^2$. Weshow that the proposed pipeline can be applied to sequence of complex scenesinvolving high relief and glacierized terrain and that the resulting DEMs canbe used to compute long term glacier elevation changes over large areas.\t\n",

Young\tDate : 2022/02/08\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03657v1\tTexte : X-ray reflection from an accretion disc produces characteristic emissionlines allowing us to probe the innermost regions in AGN. We investigate theseemission lines under a framework of Riemannian geometrical optics where thecorona has a refractive index of $n \\neq 1$. The empty space outside is avacuum with $n = 1$. The Kerr metric is modified to trace the light rays thatare bent due to not only the gravity of the black hole, but also the effects ofcoronal plasma dependent on $n$. The choice of $n$ alters the null geodesics,producing the effect which is analogous to the light deflection. For the coronawith $n > 1$, the disc on the far side within the corona covers a larger areaon the observer' sky, enhancing the blue wing of the line and producing moreflux difference between the blue peak and extended red tail. The inverseeffects are seen when $n < 1$. Moreover, the corona with $n > 1$ and $n < 1$could induce extra shifts in the blue wing ($\\Delta g_{max}$) to higher andlower energy, respectively. These effects are more prominent when theinclination angle is $\\gtrsim 60^\\circ$ and the corona extends to $\\gtrsim5r_g$. To obtain the deviation of the line shift of $\\Delta g_{\\rm max} \\gtrsim0.01$, the difference between the refractive index of the corona and that ofthe empty space must be $\\Delta n \\gtrsim 0.5%$. Finally, the lensing coronacan influence the arrival time of photons that may affect the observedvariability of these emission lines\t\n",

Under the core--corona picture,contributions from both equilibrated (core) and non-equilibrated (corona)components are implemented. I describe the dynamical separation of the systeminto the core and corona at the initial stage by incorporating the core--coronapicture into the novel dynamical initialization framework. With DCCI2, Isimulate $p$+$p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=7, 13$ TeV and $Pb$+$Pb$ collisions at$\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV. Especially, I extract the fractions of coreand corona components in final hadron yields in $p$+$p$ and $Pb$+$Pb$collisions as functions of multiplicity, and reveal that the core componentsbecome dominant at $\\langle dN_{\\mathrm{ch}}/d\\eta \\rangle_{|\\eta|<0.5} \\approx20$. I also find that the corona contribution at very low $p_T$ (below$p_T\\approx1$ GeV) is non-negligible even in $Pb$+$Pb$ collisions and show thatsuch contributions significantly affect $p_T$-integrated flow coefficients.These results strongly suggest the importance of considering non-equilibratedcomponents to extract transport coefficients of quark-gluon plasma frommodel-to-data comparisons quantitatively.\t\n",

EPOS 3 takes into accounthydrodynamically expanding bulk matter, jets and the jet-medium interaction.The basis of this model is multiple scatterings where each scattering finallyproduces flux tube / string. In the higher multiplicity event classes where theflux tube/string density is higher, there is a finite probability that thestrings will pick up quarks and antiquarks (or diquarks) from the bulk (core)for flux tube breaking to produce jet hadrons (corona) instead of producingthem via usual Schwinger mechanism. This will eventually create a correlationbetween core and corona and also influence the corona-corona correlation as thecorona particles containing quarks and antiquarks (or diquarks) from the bulkalso carry the fluid information. We report the relative contributions of thecore-core, core-corona, corona-core and corona-corona correlations towards theridge in the high and low multiplicity p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = $5.02 TeV using the data generated by EPOS 3.

      "Titre : Disk-corona modeling for spectral index and luminosity correlation of  tidal disruption events\tAuteur : T. Mageshwaran, Sudip Bhattacharyya\tDate : 2023/05/04\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02639v1\tTexte : We present a relativistic disk-corona model for a steady state advectiveaccretion disk to explain the UV to X-ray spectral index $\\alpha_{\\text{OX}}$evolution of \\textbf{four} tidal disruption event (TDE) sources XMMSL2J1446,XMMSL1J1404, XMMSL1J0740, \\textbf{and AT2018fyk}. The viscous stress in ourmodel depends on gas ($P_g$) and total ($P_t$) pressures as $\\tau_{r\\phi}\\propto P_g^{\\mu} P_t^{1-\\mu}$, where $\\mu$ is a constant. We compare varioussteady and time-dependent sub-Eddington TDE accretion models along with ourdisk-corona model to the observed $\\alpha_{\\text{OX}}$ of TDE sources and findthat the disk-corona model agrees with the observations better than the othermodels. We find that $\\mu$ is much smaller than unity for TDE sourcesXMMSL2J1446, XMMSL1J1404, and XMMSL1J0740. We also compare the relativisticmodel with a non-relativistic disk-corona model. The relativistic accretiondynamics reduce the spectral index relative to the non-relativistic accretionby increasing the energy transport to the corona. We estimate the massaccretion rate for all the sources and find that the observed luminosityfollows a nearly linear relation with the mass accretion rate. The ratio ofX-ray luminosity from the disk to the corona increases with the mass accretionrate. The observed $\\alpha_{\\text{OX}}$ shows positive and negativecorrelations with luminosity. The disk-corona model explains the negativecorrelation seen in the TDE sources XMMSL1J0740, XMMSL2J1446, and XMMSL1J1404.However, TDE AT2018fyk shows a positive correlation at higher luminosity andshows a better fit when a simple spherical adiabatic outflow model is added tothe relativistic disk-corona model. Even though the disk luminosity dominatesat a higher mass accretion rate, we show that the accretion models without acorona are unable to explain the observations, and the presence of a corona isessential.\t\n",
      "Titre : Swirls in the Solar Corona\tAuteur : C. Breu, H. Peter, R. Cameron, S. K. Solanki\tDate : 2023/05/05\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03769v1\tTexte : Vortex flows have been found in the photosphere, chromosphere and low coronain observations and simulations. It has been suggested that vortices play animportant role for channeling energy and plasma into the corona, but the impactof vortex flows on the corona has not directly been studied in a realisticsetup. We investigate the role vortices play for coronal heating using highresolution simulations of coronal loops. The vortices are not artificiallydriven, but arise self-consistently from magnetoconvection. We perform 3Dresistive MHD simulations with the MURaM code. Studying an isolated coronalloop in a Cartesian geometry allows us to resolve the structure of the loopinterior. We conduct a statistical analysis to determine vortex properties as afunction of height from the chromosphere into the corona. We find that theenergy injected into the loop is generated by internal coherent motions withinstrong magnetic elements. A significant part of the resulting Poynting flux ischanneled through the chromosphere in vortex tubes forming a magneticconnection between the photosphere and corona. Vortices can form contiguousstructures that reach up to coronal heights, but in the corona itself thevortex tubes get deformed and eventually lose their identity with increasingheight. Vortices show increased upward directed Poynting flux and heating rateboth in the chromosphere and corona, but their effect becomes less pronouncedwith increasing height. While vortices play an important role for the energytransport and structuring in the chromosphere and low corona, their importancehigher up in the atmosphere is less clear since the swirls are lessdistinguishable from their environment. Vortex tubes reaching the corona show acomplex relationship with the coronal emission.\t\n",

      "Titre : The contribution and FIP bias of three types of materials inside ICMEs  associated with different flare intensities\tAuteur : Hui Fu, Xinzheng Shi, Zhenghua Huang, Youqian Qi, Lidong Xia\tDate : 2023/09/18\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09434v1\tTexte : The studies on the origination and generation mechanisms of ICME materialsare crucial for understanding the connection between CMEs and flares. Thematerials inside ICMEs can be classified into three types, coming from coronadirectly (corona-materials), heated by magnetic reconnection in corona(heated-corona-materials), and generated by chromospheric evaporation(chromospheric-evaporation-materials). Here, the contribution and FirstIonization Potential (FIP) bias of three types of materials inside ICMEsassociated with different flare intensities are analyzed and compared. We findthat the speeds and scales of near-Earth ICMEs both increase with flareintensities. The proportions of heated-corona-materials are nearly constantwith flare intensities. The contributions of corona-materials(chromospheric-evaporation-materials) are significantly decreased (increased)with flare intensities. More than two-thirds of materials arechromospheric-evaporation-materials for ICMEs associated with strong flares.The FIP bias of corona-materials and heated-corona-materials is almost thesame. The FIP bias of chromospheric-evaporation-materials is significantlyhigher than that of corona-materials and heated-corona-materials, and it isincreased with flare intensities. The above characteristics of FIP bias can beexplained reasonably by the origination and generation mechanisms of threetypes of ICME materials. The present study demonstrates that the originationand generation mechanisms of ICME materials are significantly influenced byflare intensities. The reasons for the elevation of FIP bias, if ICMEs areregarded as a whole, are that the FIP bias ofchromospheric-evaporation-materials is much higher, and thechromospheric-evaporation-materials contributed significantly to the ICMEswhich associated with strong flares.\t\n",

      "Titre : Magnetic-Reconnection-Heated Corona Model: Implication of Hybrid  Electrons for Hard X-ray Emission of Luminous Active Galactic Nuclei\tAuteur : Jie-Ying Liu, Jirong Mao, B. F. Liu\tDate : 2023/11/22\tURL : http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13135v2\tTexte : It is widely accepted that X-ray emission in luminous active galactic nuclei(AGNs) originates from hot corona. To prevent the corona from over-cooling bystrong X-ray emission, steady heating to the corona is essential, for which themost promising mechanisms is the magnetic reconnection. Detailed studies of thecoupled disc and corona, in the frame of magnetic field transferringaccretion-released energy from the disc to the corona, reveal that the thermalelectrons can only produce X-ray spectrum with $\\Gamma_{\\rm 2-10\\,keV}>2.1$,which is an inevitable consequence of the radiative coupling of the thermalcorona and disc. In the present work, we develop themagnetic-reconnection-heated corona model by taking into account the potentialnon-thermal electrons accelerated in the magnetic reconnection process, inaddition to the thermal electrons. We show that the features of the structureand spectrum of the coupled disc and corona can be affected by the fraction ofmagnetic energy allocated to thermal electrons. Furthermore, we investigate theeffects of the power-law index and energy range of non-thermal electrons andthe magnetic field on the spectrum. It is found that the X-ray spectrum fromthe Comptonization of the hybrid electrons can be flatter than that fromthermal electrons only, in agreement with observations. By comparing with theobserved hard X-ray data, we suggest that a large fraction ($>40\\%$) of themagnetic energy be allocated to the non-thermal electrons in the luminous andflat X-ray spectrum AGNs.\t\n",
